# Strata Synthetic Data Pipeline

Blender-based pipeline that generates labeled training data for Strata's AI models (semantic segmentation, joint prediction, weight prediction, drawn pose estimation). Also houses animation intelligence scripts and curated metadata for animation training. Runs independently of the Strata codebase.

## What This Project Does

Generates labeled training data (color images, segmentation masks, draw order maps, joint positions, weight maps) from rigged 3D characters across 6 art styles. Also includes: Spine 2D parser (`pipeline/spine_parser.py`), BVH mocap pipeline (`animation/`), Label Studio annotation (`annotation/`), and external dataset adapters (`ingest/`). Target: 300+ characters, 36K+ images. See `docs/preprocessed-datasets.md` for planned external data sources.

## Project Layout

Key dirs: `pipeline/` (Blender rendering + segmentation), `ingest/` (external dataset adapters), `annotation/` (Label Studio), `animation/` (BVH/mocap), `tests/`, `docs/`. Entry points: `run_pipeline.py`, `run_validation.py`. Config: `pipeline/config.py`.

**Tracked:** `pipeline/`, `ingest/`, `annotation/`, `animation/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `data/*/labels/`. **Ignored:** `data/` (large binaries), `output/` (generated).

Label mappings live in `data/{source}/labels/` (e.g., `data/live2d/labels/live2d_mappings.csv`).

## Running the Pipeline

```bash
blender --background --python run_pipeline.py -- \
  --input_dir ./data/fbx/ \
  --pose_dir ./data/poses/ \
  --output_dir ./output/segmentation/ \
  --styles flat,cel,pixel,painterly,sketch,unlit \
  --resolution 512 \
  --poses_per_character 20
```

Requires Blender 4.0+ (uses bundled Python 3.10+). No GPU needed — EEVEE flat shading runs on CPU.

## Key Technical Details

### Strata Standard Skeleton (21 body regions + background = 22 classes)

| ID | Region | ID | Region |
|----|--------|----|--------|
| 0 | background | 11 | upper_arm_r |
| 1 | head | 12 | forearm_r |
| 2 | neck | 13 | hand_r |
| 3 | chest | 14 | upper_leg_l |
| 4 | spine | 15 | lower_leg_l |
| 5 | hips | 16 | foot_l |
| 6 | shoulder_l | 17 | upper_leg_r |
| 7 | upper_arm_l | 18 | lower_leg_r |
| 8 | forearm_l | 19 | foot_r |
| 9 | hand_l | 20 | accessory |
| 10 | shoulder_r | 21 | hair_back |

### Bone Mapping Priority

1. Exact match → 2. Prefix match → 3. Substring match (case-insensitive) → 4. Manual override JSON

Mixamo characters should map 100% automatically. Non-Mixamo ~80% auto, ~20% manual via per-character override JSON.

### Segmentation Mask Rendering

- 22 Emission-only materials (one per region), no lighting
- Each mesh face assigned to region by majority vote of vertex bone weights
- No anti-aliasing, nearest-neighbor sampling — each pixel = exactly one region ID
- Output: 8-bit single-channel grayscale PNG (pixel value = region ID)

### Output Format

Per training example:
```
example_001/
├── image.png           ← Character render (512×512)
├── segmentation.png    ← Per-pixel label IDs (grayscale)
├── draw_order.png      ← Per-pixel depth (grayscale, 0=back 255=front)
├── joints.json         ← 2D joint positions
└── metadata.json       ← Source type, style, pose name, camera angle, draw order values
```

Draw order is computed from vertex Z-depth relative to camera (Mixamo) or from explicit render order indices (Live2D). Normalized to [0, 1] range per frame.

### Render Setup

- Orthographic camera (no perspective distortion)
- Auto-framed to character bounding box + 10% padding
- 512×512 output resolution
- Transparent background (alpha channel)
- Minimal lighting: single directional + high ambient (~0.7)
- **Multi-angle rendering**: 5 camera angles per character×pose — front (0°), three-quarter (45°), side (90°), three-quarter-back (135°), back (180°). Enabled via `--angles` CLI flag; defaults to front-only. Required for 3D mesh pipeline training data.

### Style Augmentation

Render-time (Blender shaders): flat, cel/toon, unlit
Post-render (Python/PIL/OpenCV): pixel art, painterly, sketch/lineart

Masks are per-pose, NOT per-style — the same mask applies to all style variants of a pose.

### Dataset Splits

Split by **character**, not by image (prevents data leakage). 80% train / 10% val / 10% test.

## Asset Sources

Only use CC0, CC-BY, or CC-BY-SA licenses. Never CC-NC. Log every asset's license in output metadata. Full source list in `docs/data-sources.md`, external datasets in `docs/preprocessed-datasets.md`.

## Validation Checks

Automated (run after every batch):
- Every non-transparent pixel has a non-zero mask region
- No mask is all-one-region
- All joint positions within image bounds
- 19 joints per pose
- Every image has a corresponding mask and joint file
- All images exactly 512×512
- No single region >60% of pixels

## Conventions

- Naming pattern: `{source}_{id}_pose_{nn}_{style}.png` for images, `{source}_{id}_pose_{nn}.png` for masks
- JSON metadata uses the schema defined in the PRD (sections 8.2–8.3)
- v1 is humanoid bipeds only. Non-humanoid (quadruped, bird, serpentine) is future work.
- Accessories: hide for v1 (cleaner training data). Flag with `has_accessories: true` in metadata.

## Storage Policy

- **Hetzner bucket** — upload only training-ready output (validated `output/` data: images, masks, joints, metadata). No raw source assets.
- **External hard drive** — store all raw/source data locally: FBX characters, BVH mocap, VRM files, sprite sheets, Live2D models, pre-processed external datasets. Download and process from here; do not upload raw data to the cloud bucket.
